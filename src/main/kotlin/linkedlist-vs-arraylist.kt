/*
* ArrayList
*   is an implementation of the List interface that is based on an array. ArrayList internally handles resizing of
*   this array when the elements are added or removed. You can access its elements in constant time by their index in
*   the array. However, inserting or removing an element infers shifting all consequent elements which may be slow if the
*   array is huge and the inserted or removed element is close to the beginning of the list.
*
* LinkedList
*   is a doubly-linked list: single elements are put into Node objects that have references to previous and
*   next Node. This implementation may appear more efficient than ArrayList if you have lots of insertions or deletions in
*   different parts of the list, especially if the list is large.
*
*  In most cases, however, ArrayList outperforms LinkedList. Even elements shifting in ArrayList, while being an O(n)
*  operation, is implemented as a very fast System.arraycopy() call. It can even appear faster than the LinkedListâ€˜s O(1)
*  insertion which requires instantiating a Node object and updating multiple references under the hood. LinkedList
*  also can have a large memory overhead due to a creation of multiple small Node objects.
